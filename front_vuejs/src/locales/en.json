My research focuses on the use of collaborative 3D digital models in urban planning.<br> I will help you throughout this study. Your answers are precious to me because they will allow me to better understand how you perceive 3D digital models. The purpose of this step is to help me to legitimize the use of these models in participatory approaches. In other words, to give you, new possibilities, as a citizen, to share your opinion and make your voice heard in urban development projects.",
